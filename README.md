# Building-and-Optimizing-Neural-network
This repository provides an implementation of a basic neural network using the PyTorch/Keras library. The neural network is trained on a dataset consisting of seven features and a binary target. The goal of the neural network is to predict the binary target accurately.

# Part 1 - Building Neural-network

Step 1: Loading the Dataset

Step 2: Preprocessing the Dataset
Before training the neural network, the dataset needs to be preprocessed. Perform the following preprocessing steps:
- Convert categorical variables to numerical variables using one-hot encoding. The OneHotEncoder from scikit-learn can be used for this purpose.
- Scale numerical variables to have zero mean and unit variance. The StandardScaler from scikit-learn or Normalize from PyTorch can be used for this purpose.
- Split the dataset into training and validation sets using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn.
-
Step 3: Defining the Neural Network
Define the architecture of the neural network by specifying the following:
- Number of input neurons
- Activation function for the hidden layers (ReLU is suggested)
- Number of hidden layers (start with a small network, e.g., 2 or 3 layers)
- Size of each hidden layer (e.g., 64 or 128 nodes for each layer)
- Activation function for the hidden and output layers

Step 4: Training the Neural Network
Training the neural network involves the following steps:
- Set up the training loop: Create a loop that iterates over the training data for a specified number of epochs. For each epoch, iterate over the batches of the training data, compute the forward pass through the neural network, compute the loss, compute the gradients using backpropagation, and update the weights of the network using an optimizer (e.g., Stochastic Gradient Descent or Adam).
- Define the loss function: Choose a loss function that computes the error between the predicted output of the neural network and the true labels of the training data. Binary Cross Entropy Loss is commonly used for binary classification problems.
Choose an optimizer and a learning rate: Select an optimizer (e.g., SGD, Adam, or RMSProp) and a learning rate. The optimizer will update the weights of the neural network during training.
- Train the neural network: Run the training loop and train the neural network on the training data. Monitor the training loss and validation loss at each epoch to prevent overfitting.
- Evaluate the performance: Evaluate the performance of the model on the testing data. The expected accuracy for this task is more than 75%.
Save the trained model weights: Save the weights of the trained neural network for future use.
- Visualize the results: Use visualization techniques such as confusion matrices to analyze the performance of the model.


# Part 2- Optimizing Neural network

Hyperparameter Tuning
Hyperparameters are modified individually while keeping the neural network structure and other parameters fixed. The following table shows the results of different setups for each tuned hyperparameter:

Hyperparameter	Setup 1 Test Accuracy	Setup 2 Test Accuracy	Setup 3 Test Accuracy
- Dropout			
- Optimizer			
- Activation Function			
- Initializer			
- Base Model Selection
- After completing hyperparameter tuning, the model setup with the best accuracy is chosen as the base model for further optimization.

Optimization Methods
Four different optimization methods are explored to enhance the base model:
- Early Stopping: Implement early stopping to prevent overfitting. Track the validation loss and stop training if it does not improve after a certain number of epochs.
- K-Fold Cross Validation: Perform k-fold cross validation to evaluate the model's performance on different subsets of the dataset. Calculate the average accuracy across all folds.
- Learning Rate Scheduler: Implement a learning rate scheduler to dynamically adjust the learning rate during training. This can help optimize the training process and improve convergence.
- Data Augmentation: Apply data augmentation techniques to increase the size and diversity of the training data. This can help the model generalize better and improve accuracy.
